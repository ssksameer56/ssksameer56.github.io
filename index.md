Iâ€™m currently working in a CityMall as an SDE-2. Primarily, a backend developer who works on APIs and microservices that makes things possible. This blog serves as a repository of logging my experiences at work and life.

Apart from development, I am interested in topics such as political theory, sociology and history. You can find me reading books, majorly non-fiction. I'm currently powering through the Stormlight Archive. [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/sameerkolpekwar)
